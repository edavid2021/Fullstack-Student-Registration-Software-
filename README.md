# AWS deployment of Fullstack Student Registration Application

http://3.129.92.113/

#### Emmanuel David / Z23619905

##### This project which is comprised of a nodejs backend and a react frontend, allows users to:

* Add a student to the MongoDB Database
* Display a single student and provide
* Updating a single student
* Deleting a student
* Listing all the students
* Search for a student by last name

##### All while providing the user with a notification showing whether it was successful or not and showing the results in a user friendly table.

For this project, I used React.js, Express.js, Node.js, Cors, Axios, and Bootstrap.
